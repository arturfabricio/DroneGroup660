mavic2proPython is direct copy from this repository: https://github.com/alpinmaarif/Webots-DJI-Mavic-2-Pro-PID-Controller
mavic2proNoCSV does not use the CSV file "params", still a PID-tuned drone (hovering in place).
droneControl2 is only PD-controlled, drifts forwards after taking off
ControllerDrone currently has an issue that makes Webots crash (BAD!)
